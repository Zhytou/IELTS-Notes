## Topics

### Basic

#### Work

    1. Do you work or are you a student?
    I'm a university student right now and my major is Information Engineering, which is a combination of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science. I can learn both hardware-related and software-related knowledge.

    2. Did you always want to do this?
    Well, being a software engineer was not my initial career plan. Back in secondary school, I always dreamed of becoming a basketball player because I was a big fan of the NBA. But after I grew older and became more realistic and practical, I chose to become a software engineer because I found it more challenging, demanding, most importantly lucrative.

    3. Do you work/study best in the morning or afternoon?
    Personally, I prefer to study in the afternoon. Because I am a night owl, when I try to study in the morning, I tend to be too tired and unfocused.

    4. Do you sometimes have to study really hard?
    Absolutely, the last time when I had to study hard is for my course project. I was asked to redesign an antenna, the facility that is used on most electronic devices(laptops or mobile phones) to transmit and receive information. I had to read a lot of research papers and take out simulations or experiments to finish the task. Luckily, I finished in time and got a nice score.

    5. What do you often do once you have finished class/work?
    I always check my social media when I accomplish my work. For example, I'm fond of watching interesting videos or vlogs on Bilibili, the Chinese version of Youtube to unwind myself.

    6. Do you like your job?
    Definitely, I love my job. I love the work I do and I like to be productive in my job field. In fact, my job brings me my bread and butter and I am grateful for having a nice job in a prestigious organisation.

#### Accomodation

    1. Where are you currently living?
    I live in Hangzhou and to be specific I live in the dormitory of my campus.

    2. What do you like about the place where you live?
    It's convenient in terms of traveling time. As a college student, I only need to commute from my living place to the classroom during the weekdays. And living in the dormitory means that I do not need to suffer from long journeys or traffic jams during the weekdays. Also, compared with living outside the school like in an apartment, it's quite cheap and can save me a fortune.

    3. Do you know many people who live close to you?
    Yeah, in fact, all of my classmates are living on the same floor but in several rooms. So yes, I know a couple of people who live close to me and I even like to go to their room and have a chat with them. One of my basketball teammates also lives next door.

    4. Do you live in a house or an apartment?
    I guess it's an apartment. In fact, I live in the dormitory of my school.

    5. What is your favorite room in your home?
    Oh, definitely my cozy bedroom. It is a private space for me and no one can enter it without my permission. I feel comfortable and safe lying in bed. During my leisure time, I usually spend my time in my bedroom and enjoy playing LOL with my friends or chatting with strangers online.

    6. What makes your home pleasant to live in?
    My home is a habitable and pleasant place for me to escape from a busy and hectic work routine, recharge, and spend time with loved ones. To begin with, it is neat. I always help my mom with house cleaning, like sweeping or mopping the floor and tidying up the kitchen. In addition, I love the decoration and facility of my home. My mom raises several potted plants on the balcony, it is delightful to sit there, reading a newspaper.

#### Hometown

    1. What's your hometown and where is it?
    My hometown is Chengdu City, the capital city of Sichuan Province. It is located in southwest China.

    2. Is that a big city or a small place?
    It is a conurbation. I mean, considering the population, development, and economy, it is undeniably the top 1 city in the southwest part of China.

    3. Please describe your hometown a little.
    Chengdu is famous for its hot and spicy food and attracts thousands of tourists from all over the world. Residents are quite welcoming and kind, so visitors can easily get a hand from them. Also, Chengdu has unique natural and man-made landscapes. For example, both the giant panda reserve and the Dujiangyan irrigation system are located in Chengdu. On top of that, we have our own dialect and we are proud of our accents.

    4. How long have you been living there?
    About 18 years. Before I went to university in Zhejiang, I had always been living there and there are so many memories.

    5. Is there anything you dislike about it?
    The weather I guess. It's quite hot in the summertime, to be honest, during the summer I turn my air conditioner on 24 hours and I don't really go out unless it is necessary. Another sad thing is that the city's modernization undermines the base of our unique culture and memory, making Chengdu more similar to other cities.

### Describe a person

#### Close People - a family member you like to work with

    Speaking of someone I'd like to work with, there are many nominees. But the first one that comes to mind is XXX. We used to study in the same high school and became really good friends. When we are together, we almost talk anything under the sun. In addition, he has a sense of humor and can always make people around him burst into laughters with his hilarious jokes. On top of that, he is supportive and helpful, and he is always ready to offer someone even strangers a hand.

    Unfortunately, I have not worked with him before, because both of us are occupied with our studies. But if given the chance, I definitely like to work with him for several reasons. To begin with, he is capable and knowledgeable. He often give me some suggestions when I get trouble with my study. Moreover, he is an optimistic individual who often see the bright side of every situation.

#### Celebrity - NBA player/Actor- a person who dresses well

    Speaking of someone who dresses fashionable, I can come up with so many nominees because celebrities, actors, famous athletes, models, and even social media influencers are always trendy and care about fashion. They may even have a tailor and a stylist. 

    I would like to describe Devin Booker, my favorite NBA basketball player who is now a Phoenix Suns guard and three-time NBA All-Star. When he was a nineteen-year-old rookie, he became the youngest player to score over sixty points in a game, finishing with seventy against the Boston Celtics. He even managed to get to the stage of the NBA offseason final in 2020. 

    Booker is known for keeping his outfits casual and comfortable while still attractive and engaging. In fact, he usually wears a normal hoodie and jeans but uses some stunning accessories such as an icy necklace or a shining watch to embellish his entire costume. I would partly attribute his ability to dress well to his girlfriend, Kendall Jenner, who is also a famous model.

### Describe a place or city

#### City - a nice place you'd recommend people to live in

    I'm going to describe CSC, the capital city of Hu Nang province. It is located in the central area of China, alongside the Yangtze. I have traveled there several times, and I enjoyed every minute of staying there. The city is famous for its food, especially the snacks such as the local bubble tea and stinky toufu.

    Actually, I'd like to recommend XXX as a wonderful place to live for several reasons. To begin with, it's a popular destination for people looking to escape the hustle and bustle of big cities. In addition, the local people are very warm and welcoming. A tourist can get the necessary help from both the people and the authorities. Moreover, the transportation system of the city is well developed. Thanks to that, I can maintain the time of my schedule.

#### Aceint/Morden - do you like old buildings or new ones?

### Describe an object

#### Electronic Devices - smartwatch - something I'd like to own in the future

    Speaking of something I'd like to own, there are many selections. But the first one that comes to mind is a smartwatch, like the newly launched iwatch of Apple. It is a new type of watch having all the features and functions of the mobile phone. You wear it on your wrist, so it is even more portable than phones. Moreover, this is a new fashion accessory that I've seen advertising everywhere, on TV, on social media, and on the billboard. I've also seen people wearing it in the department stores and high street.

    I'd like to purchase a smartwatch for several reasons. To begin with, I can synchronize it with my laptop and cellphone to get all my needs at my wrist. It's particularly convenient for me to be able to organize my life and check my appointments and work arrangements by just looking at my wrist.Another thing good about smartwatches is that it helps people keep in health. Apparently, you can track your exercise goals, even things like the steps you've taken every day.Moreover, the watches are really practical and just as good as phones in terms of technology, but it's even more portable. Personally, I'd like to call it the ultimate in portable electronic devices.

#### Electronic Devices - laptop/phone - some technology you cannot live without

#### Book/TV series - Game of Thrones - a novel you'd like to recommend others to read

    When it comes to my favorite TV series, the first one that comes to my mind is Game of Thrones. It is adapted from a series of fantasy novels called A Song of Ice and Fire. The story is mainly about the political conflicts among the noble families who either try to claim the throne or fight for independence from whoever sits on it.

    Among all the characters, I like Tyrion Lannister most, also mocked as an imp or half-man, because he is a dwarf. However, he uses his wit and intellect to overcome the prejudice he faces.
    
    I like this TV series for several reasons. To begin with, it is really appealing and attractive because of the winding plots and vivid characters, I just can't help myself keep reading it. On top of that, the effortless, natural performances of the cast really take into the situation, especially the actor who played Tyrion Lannister, my favorite character in the book. I think he should be awarded Oscars.

#### Music/Film

    One of my favorite songs is Lose Yourself, also the theme song of 8 miles, which contains autobiographical elements from the singer's life. The story follows a white rapper and his attempt to launch a career in hip hop, a music genre dominated by African Americans. The lyrics go "if you get one opportunity, one chance, would you capture it or just let it slip?", conveying the inspiring message that you should hustle for what you love and motivating you with its energy and passion. 

    I like this kind of music for two reasons. First of all, the main reason seems to be that music conveys positive and inspiring messages such as disapproving wars, praising kindness, or pursuing self-values. 

    Moreover, with the help of music, individuals from various cultural backgrounds and of different ages can get together and unite as a whole.
    
    On top of that, despite the fact that you do not understand the language of meaning, you can dance to the music because of its rhythms and flow, which means that music brings people happiness despite the barrier of language.

#### Vedio Game - LOL

    LOL

### Describe an event

#### Traditional Festivals - Spring Festival or Mid-Autumn

    When it comes to my favorite Chinese traditional festivals, I guess the answer would be the Spring Festival, which is the longest public holiday in my country. I have seven days off to travel around to unwind.

    We always celebrate it on the last day of a year according to the lunar calendar. At the time, kids will get lucky money in a red envelope for them to use. For adults,  it is a time when the big family comes together and cooks together. They can enjoy their time chatting with each other or playing poker or Marjon. 

    On top of that, we often do firecrackers to symbolize the disappearance of bad luck and things in the last year and celebrate the arrival of a new year.

    Unfortunately, it is a tradition that mainly involves old generations. According to my observation, more and more young people tend to travel around or hang out with friends, despite the fact that tourist attractions are swarming with people on public holidays. Many people have been fed up with this, so they prefer to stay at home and rest.

#### Sports Event - FIBA 2019 World Cup - an memorable event recent years

    I'm going to describe what I think was the most memorable event in recent years which was the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup, a spectacular festival of basketball over several weeks here in China. 

    I think it is a once-in-lifetime experience for us to have World Cup in our own country. Unfortunately, I was at home watching most of the Olympic Games on television. I didn't manage to get down to Beijing to see any of them in person because of the covid lockdown, yet I enjoyed them all on TV at home.

    Actually, China versus Poland is the most impressive game that I remember. It was a crazy overtime game, and there were also many ups and downs. Although we did some good pick&roll and knocked down some difficult shots at the very beginning, the Polish took the lead by doing great defense. We lost by 3 points at the end of the game. 

#### Concert/Live House

#### Lessons - something your parents taught you

    Speaking of some powerful lessons that my parents gave me and that have shaped who I am today, there are just too many.
    
    I'd like to describe two of them. My mother used to tell me to be kind to others and always show good manners, even if they do not have the qualities that I want to show respect for. But she also said that this is not a sign of weakness but a symbol of politeness and gentlemen.

    Another educative lesson is that always hustle for what you love. You can see from examples and experience that a successful result is tied to someone's ability and willingness to work harder than anyone else. Once you find where your passion is and stick to it, you can make it out one day. In other words, your success is inevitable.
    
    Another thing is that life is more about just making money and paying our bills. It is about happiness and self-realism. So never monetize your life. When I feel tired or even fed up with the nine-five routines, I know it is time for me to change a job.

    One of my favorite songs, Lose Yourself, also the theme song of the film, 8 miles, featured by Eminem has the lyrics that go "if you get one opportunity, one chance, would you capture it or just let it slip?"

### Descirbe an experience

#### Romantic/Lovely/Happy Gift

### Angry/Sad Thing - eatout vs. eat at home

    Eating out can be a very pleasurable experience. Having dinner with a friend, eating a romantic meal while on a date, or celebrating some special event with a party at a restaurant are all things we enjoy doing. 

    My City is quite multicultural, so there are plenty of choices for me to choose a place or a dish to eat. Once I decided to eat at a fancy Japanese restaurant with my friends and made reservations. When we arrived the restaurant, We were seated promptly in a cozy, comfortable booth. After ordering the dish, our waitress began to serve our meals.

    By appearances, our steaks looked so delicious and the roasted veggies smelled delightful. I was famished and my taste buds were already bursting with excitement! It tasted really good.

    However, one of my friends was disappointed to see that his steak was undercooked, thinking our orders were mixed up. So we summoned the waitress and explained the situation. She apologized and removed his plate. Within a minute or two, the manager came to our table to apologize for the mishap and told me she would not charge his portion of the bill.

    Despite the unhappy mistaken dish and a little bit higher expense than we expected, it was still enjoyable to eat at this restaurant because of its good service and tasty food.

    The main reason why I prefer eating at home seems to be the lower expense of eating at home. Obviously, when we eat at home we do the preparation, cooking, and serving of the food ourselves and, therefore, do not need to pay the labor costs of the cook, waiter, and other restaurant staff. Secondly, eating at home is much better for our health and wellbeing than dining outside. When cooking for ourselves, we can control the amount of salt and oil we use and balance our diet to suit our own individual needs. Finally, eating at home is much more comfortable than having dinner or lunch in a public place. Sitting in my casual clothes, even pajamas, in front of the TV, with a good, home-cooked meal in front of me, I am happy with that.

### Describe an activity or a favarite thing

#### School/Classes/Exams - a time you were very busy/a difficut thing you did and succeeded/a time when you needed to search for information

    I'm going to talk about my graduation project. I was asked to redesign a dual polarized horn antenna feed with specific requirements on indexes like isolation and frequency.

    Before this, I only attended a class called the theories of electronic and magnetic waves in sophomore year and forgot most of the notions and definitions. So I had to review key points like the modes and the cut-off frequency of rectangular waveguides. In addition, I learned the software, CST studio, commonly used in antenna simulation and design. Thanks to the study resources on youtube, I  could pick up stuff quickly.

    In the following days, I began to read research papers and decided to use orthogonal mode couplers, some kind of coupling structure, to realize dual polarization.

    With the help of my mentor and friends, I soon got four distinct prototypes of dual-polarized antennas, and then came the parameter optimization to reach the target. After two months, I was able to finish my graduation paper with all the data and structures.

    I had a sense of achievement because the task was really difficult for me and I put every effort on it.

#### Sports/Healthy Habits - Basketball - something health I enjoy

    When it comes to something health I enjoy doing, the first thing that comes to mind is basketball. Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender's hoop.

    I began to play basketball in middle school, motivated by NBA. I am a big fan of James Harden, my favorite basketball player who now plays for the Philadelphia Sixers. I usually play basketball with my friends on the court of my campus.

    I play basketball for several reasons. To begin with, basketball is a fast-moving game that involves a lot of variety, including shooting, dribbling, passing, rebounding, defense, and much more, so it is a great workout helping me burn calories and keep in shape. Moreover, I need to make sure every part of my body engages in perfect sync with each other when playing the sport, which means basketball improves balance and coordination. In addition, the sport is more than physical exercise, it also requires strategy and teamwork. Basketball teaches me about being a good team player and can be a great social sport.

#### Food/Snacks - something you like to eat

    Speaking of snacks I like to eat, there are many choices. But the first one that comes to my mind is the crispy and salty potato chips. I usually eat it when watching TV series or animes, and I prefer to pair it with a bottle of cold coke or bubble tea.

    The main reason why I like chips seems to be that they are just so delicious that I can help myself to continuously eat them, though they are unhealthy food, even regarded as junk food. To be honest, I can imagine my life without it.

    My favorite dish is scrambled eggs with tomatoes. The dish consists of scrambled seasoned eggs, diced tomato, and a little minced green onion for decoration. When it comes to its flavor, I think it is sour and a little bit sweet. The best part of the dish is the eggs which intake the sour tomato stock.

    I like to eat the XXX for several reasons. To begin with, it is tasty, because I am a big fan of scrambled eggs and I like the texture of this dish. Moreover, it always reminds me of my mother, because she used to cook this dish. On top of that, it is easy to cook and the ingredients are cheap to buy. It is the first dish I learned how to cook. One more good thing about it is that it is healthy to eat because it contains lots of protein and vitamins.

## Example

### Part1

#### Morning Time

    Do you like getting up early in the morning?

    To be honest, I don't like to get up early in the morning. I actaully consider myself as a night owl

    What do you usually do in the morning?

    I usually get up at 9 o'clock or even later if I don't have any morning lecture. After I wash up, I tend to go to the library to study

    What did you do in the morning when you were little? Why?

    Back to my primary school times, my father always woke me up at 7 in the morning and we would have breakfast together. After a quick breakfast, my father would send me to school using his electrical bike, because there were few public transport at that time in our city.

    Are there any differences between what you do in the morning now and what you did in the past?

    Yeah, the most important thing is that no one would wake me up these days and this is great. 

    Do you spend your mornings doing the same thing on both weekends and weekdays?

#### Housework and cooking

    Do you do some cooking or help your family cook at home now?

    Yes, I'm actually quite fond of cookery. During summer vacation or winter vacation, I have to cook for my younger brother because our parents are occupied with work and eating out is unrealistic to afford.

    Do you think your home is clean and tidy?

    Yes, of course. My mother always requires all the family members to keep the house clean and tidy and we sweep floors on a weekly base.

    Did you do house cleaning when you were young?

    Yes, as I mentioned before, my parents ask us to participate in house cleaning, beacause they think it's helpful to both physical and mental health. House cleaning involves a various movements and burn lots of calories.

    Do you have breakfast at home every day?

    No, not really. I would prefer to purchase some readily prepared foof at a foodstand or just grab a bread and a bottle of milk as my breakfast, because having breakfast at breakfast means that I have to get up early and cook for breakfast

    Do you want to learn how to cook well?

    Yes. Cooking is a practical and essential skill especially for young people like me who are about to work in a different city and live alone. If I can cook well, I would save a fortune which are used on takeaway and live a healthier life.

#### Technology

    What technology do you often use, computers or cellphones?

    To be honest, I use both computers and cellphones very frequently. I need my laptop to read research papers, do my homework, and attend online lectures, whereas I use my phone mainly for entertainment. But if I have to choose, my answer would probably be my mobile phone, because it is more handy and convenient compared to computers. I can carry it 24 * 7.

    What eletronic devices have you bought lately?

    I bought a pair of brand new wireless blue tooth headphones several months ago. It really cost me a fortune, about 400 rmb but I think it worth the price becuase compared to traditional wired ones, it is more convenient and are able connect to your smartphone without a wire, which means that I leave my phone on the table outside the bathroom, while listening to music with my headphones. 

    Is there any technology you want to buy?

    Yeah, of course. I would say a pair of VR glasses because I was impressed and fasinated by advertisements about it on biilboard and youtube. I always think about using this kind of devices to watch movies or play vedio games.

    Is technology important in your life?

    Absolutely yes. Technology is used in many areas of my lives. You may be able to understand technology when you watch TV, use your phone, drive a vehicle, or use a computer.

    Is there any technology you don't like?

    Yeah, I get fed up with the health code.

#### Public transportation

    What kind of public transportation do you usually take?

    Subway. I prefer subways, because compared to bus, it is more comfortable and time-saving. Another thing is that subway is more punctual, meaning that there will be a subway train every 6 minutes.

    When do you usually take public transportation, in your everyday life or when you are travelling?
    
    I think I use public transportation in both my everyday life and when I am travelling. Because I am a university student right now, taking subways instead of calling a uber is much more affordable for me and saves me a foutune. In addition to this, my family has to support me so I do not really want place heavy finnacial burden on them.

    Do most people prefer public transportation in your country?

    Yeah, I think so. According to my observation, people prefer public transportation especially when travelling long distance. Low price or cost may be one reason and it's also more comfortable compared to driving yourself. When commuting from inner-city to suburban areas, congestion is inevitable, meaning you may have to suffer from long waiting time.

    Did you take public transportation when you were a kid?

    Yes, I used to take public transportation to commute from home to primary school when my parents were occupied with their job and could not pick me up after school.

    Will there be more people taking public transportation in the future?

    From my point of view, I think there will be a rise in popularity of public transportation. There are several reasons for it. To begin with, the authorities would encourage residents to use more public transportation because it reduces green gas emission and improves the well-being of whole society. In addition to this, people may use it because of its low price.

#### Weather

    What's the weather like where you live?

    It's wet and moist

    Do you prefer cold or hot weather?

    Do you prefer dry or wet weather?

    Dry weather for sure.

    Are you in the habit of checking the weather forecast? When/How often?

    Well, it depends. If I am in my home

    What did you do on your birthday when you were young?
    For

#### Writing

    Do you write a lot?

    Yes, except writing research papers or academic notes for my study, I keep a habit of writing dairies to record what I am thinking about. I find it a good way for me to clam down, especially when I am confronting dilemmas. I just write down all the possible choices for the situation and compare the pros and cons of it to make a wise decision.

    Why do you like write? Why?

    As I mentioned before, I have to write something for academic purpose and I also tend to write especially when I am confronting dilemmas and have to make a choice. The reason is that I write to calm down and make a wise choice.

    Do you think the things you write would change?
    Yeah, of course. As for my daries, the contents invole my daily life so it definitely change on daily basis.

    Do you prefer typing or handwriting when you are writing?
    
    Well, it depends. When I need to write formally for the academic purpose, I prefer to write on my laptop. But if I write my daries, I tend to handwtrite because I feel more focused and concentrated on the stuff.

#### Names

    Does your name have any special meaning?
    
    Yeah, my first name actually means ocean in Chinese.

#### Snacks

    What snacks do you like to eat?

#### Singing

    Do you like singing? Why?

    I don't think I like singing.

    Have you ever learnt how to sing?

    No, not really. I never take any professional lesson about singing. I just imitate/mimic and sing along with the rhythm.

    Who do you want to sing for?

    No one. I don't know because I am not the kind of person who can easily express their emotions through songs. I tend to hide my feelings. But if I have to sing, I would probably sing for my girlfriend at our wedding ceremony.

    Do you think singing can bring happiness to people?
    
    Yes, of course. Singers can convey positive messages to audience through tones or lyrics. No one would avoid beautiful melodies or enjoyable songs.

#### Geography

    Do you like geography?

    Have you ever studied geography at school?

    Are you good at reading a map?

    Would you visit a country because of its geographical location?

#### Social Media

    Do you or your friends like using social media?

    Yeah, absolutely. Social media gain a wide range of popularity among the young generations. I think that every friend of mine gets at least one social media account. 

    Do you think you or your friends using too much social media?

    Yes, I think I definitely need to use less social media especially when I have to concentrate on my study. Social media can sometimes be toxic and distracted. Those who are lack of self-control can be addicated to it. And for young children 

    Do you want to work in social media? Why?

    No, not really. I don't really like to be an instagram influencer or a content producer on Youtube, because I don't think I am creative or knowledge enough to continuously make vedios

    What's the most popular social media in China? Why?

    Probably tiktok I think. People can easily burst into laugters with the harlirious short videos, which brings a lot of fun to their life. In addition to this, users can even learn something on this app within a couple of minutes. For example, they can learn how to cook a dish or how to strench out their body and lose weight at home.

    Do you do puzzles in your childhood?

    Yes of course, I've done all kinds of puzzles including number puzzles, word puzzles and j. The most I have done I remember was the word puzzles on the newspaper I subscribed for English studies.

    When do you do puzzles, during your trip or when you feel bored?

    Well, to be honest, I'm not a big fan of puzzles, so I seldom do that, even though I have spare time. I prefer watching movies or listening to music.

    Do you like doing word puzzles or number puzzles? Which is more difficult for you?

    Well, if I have to choose, I prefer word puzzles because they are easier and number puzzles can be chanlleging for me because I'm not good at doing math.

    Do you think it'goood for old people to do puzzles?

    Well if they have interest in this kind of games, it's definitely beneficial for them, because it's good for their mental health to slow down the aging of their brain.

### Part2

#### 受到表扬
