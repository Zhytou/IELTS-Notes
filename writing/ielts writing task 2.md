### 介绍段

#### 背景+改写观点+个人观点

题目

    Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give you own opinion.

答案

    Many people like to visit museums in their leisure time, but they have different views on whether people should be edcated or entertained when visiting a museum. In my perspective, museums can and should be both entertaining and educational.

背景句是人们公认的事实，并且不来自观点。

#### 改写观点+个人观点

题目

    Nowadays, more people are choosing to socialise online rather than face to face. Is this a positive or negative development?

答案

    An increasing number of people meet and talk to their friends online instead of in person. In my opinion, this is a negative development which can lead to isolation, potentially harmful situations and also problems later on in life.

由于题干中直接给出了一个现象，不适合总结具有普遍认知的背景句，所以采用 改写观点+个人观点的方法。

#### 背景+个人观点

### 主体段

#### 审题扣题

首先要认真阅读题干，准确总结出主体段的观点句。

#### 常规结构

(观点 + 解释 + 举例 )× n

#### 扩展方法

+ 反向假设
+ 原因解释
+ 给出例子

[例子1：讨论快餐的好处](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1RR4y1W741/?spm_id_from=333.788&vd_source=1602aa2def0a5452e1d6a6f65ea4da59)

    给出观点：快餐能节省时间

    原因解释：因为快餐食物是提前准备好的

    引用例子：和传统餐厅相比，快餐店用餐时间不到一般等等。

[例子2：讨论专业人员应该留着他们接受培训的国家](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV14N4y1T7uR/?spm_id_from=333.788&vd_source=1602aa2def0a5452e1d6a6f65ea4da59)

    给出观点：认为技术人员应该留着当地的人可能考虑他们能够国家带来回报

    原因解释，因为投入资金培训这些人就是希望他们能够帮助国家在各方面取得进步

    反向假设：如果他们能够自由选择国家，那么投入的资金等于浪费，纳税人会抱怨，国家也没有资金进行新一轮的培训

题目

    Some people think watching TV is bad for children, while others think that watching TV has more beneficial effects on children. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

审题

    注意看电视的好处和坏处都需要扣在小孩子身上。观点要简单明了，而且要添加一些扩展和解释。

思路

    电视对小孩有害：1、它对小孩学习成绩有副作用，因为电视会让小孩上瘾，以至于他们不写作业去看电视；2.电视可能导致小孩糟糕的语言或行为，因为电视里有很多不恰当的内容，小孩缺乏辨识，可能模仿说脏话或者使用暴力。

    电视对小孩有利：1、它可以给他们很好的知识扩展。比起书籍和老师，电视对小孩是极有吸引力的，所以他们更容易学到一些新知识；2、电视对小孩的社交也有帮助，因为小孩的话题往往与电视有关，如果不让小孩看电视，他可能无法融入群体，感到孤独。

题目

    The major cities in the world are growing fast and many problems occur. What are the problems that young people live in cities are faced with? What solutions do you sugest?

审题

    一定要紧扣年轻人，不能说什么交通问题或者污染问题。

思路

    较差：大城市生活成本高，年轻人收入不高而且没有积蓄，所以生活在大城市的年轻人可能是所有人中生活质量最差的

    较好：大城市有很多工作机会，但它吸引来了太多人才和精英，年轻人缺乏工作经验且没有专业技能，通常找不到理想工作

题目

    Some people think that governments should focus on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems to help people prevent illness and disease. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

审题

    关键词是focus on

思路

    首先，承认这两个因素确实能预防疾病；接着，指出还有其他更重要的因素需要政府去focus on；最后，表明出政府只关注这两个方面是不可取的。

### 总结段

一定要明确表明支持一方，反驳另一方，保证和前文形成逻辑闭环。最好，不要给出一个中庸的观点（两方都对），否则会显得考生思考不够深入。

题目

    Some people believe that professionals, such as doctors and engineers, should be required to work in the country where they did their training. Others believe both these views and give your own opinion.

思路

    我个人坚定的认为，他们得到了这些国家的帮助，至少应该在这些国家工作一段时间再去考虑别的。因为他们的能力是在训练中得到的，如果没有这些训练，他们很难有这些成就。虽然他们有自由去向往更美好的生活，但这样自私的决定会使这些发展中国家长期无法发展，这些人可能带走了很多工作机会、资源等，使这些国家长期处于贫困中，因此我认为他们至少应该先工作一段时间，再去考虑其他的事情。

    Discuss the possible arguments on both sides, and say which side you personally supprot.

答案

    你的观点：
    While family time is essential for bonding and absorbing patterns of behaviours, there are definite advantages when children are outside the family too.

题目

    Trasport delays and long journey times are a widespread phenomenon in many cities today.

    What are the causes of this problem, and how could the situation be improved?

答案

    可能原因
    1. lack of investment or funding for infrastructure in the form of high-capacity public transport and increased road space for private vecicles. -> too many use the existing network, the congestion is inevitable
    2. overcrowding in cities, whereby people migrate from the hinterlands and settle in urban areas -> putting strain on amenities, housing and above all on transport capacity -> the already strenched system is pushed to a critical point, casuing cancellation and breakdowns

    解决方法
    1. encourage investment in better infrastructure
    2. use tax incentives to allow more home working -> less need to commute from suburbs to the inner city for work

    总结段
    In conclusion, it seems that outdated infrastructure and overcrowding are the key factors behind our transport frustrations. Possible solutions would involve better funding, and also innovations in ways of working and travelling to reduce the burden on the system.

    In spite of the advances made in agriculture, many people around the world still go hungry.
    Why is this the case? What can be done about this problem? 
    Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

答案

    It is true that starvation still takes place, though agricultural technology including genetically modified food and super hybrid rice has achieved great breakthroughs these days. There are various factors such as poor cultivating conditions and severe climate change behind this frustration, but I believe the authorities and global organizations can still take steps to tackle this issue.

    The reason why people around the world can't get rid of hunger is that some places may naturally have poor cultivating conditions leading to low levels of food production. For instance, adequate rain, sunshine, and nourished soil are the main requirements for growing crops which barely exist in some countries in Africa. Moreover, some rural areas of developing countries may be little benefited from the technological advancements in agriculture, because few farmers there can apply the new methods in practice without the help of experts. In addition to this, climate change aggravates this problem. Even though some country has a rich harvest of crops, it is likely to be destroyed by flooding or other natural disasters caused by climate change.

    Regarding potential solutions, those countries which face famine need to introduce more agricultural specialists and advanced technology to rationally take advantage of the limited resource. Consequently, super seeds and plants can be invented which could stand against undesirable natural conditions even if they are not blessed with good weather conditions. Finally, it is essential to tackle climate change with immediate effect. Otherwise, it will impact the whole world in a negative way.

    In conclusion, poor cultivating conditions, inability to utilize new technology, and climate change together lead to hunger in some places around the world, but the government can introduce more agricultural specialists and advanced technology to improve the situation.

    Many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal. Some people, however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.
    Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.
    Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

作答

    Some people claim that economic progress is crucial to the development of a certain country, while others argue that governments ought to take other types of progress that are of equal importance into consideration. In my opinion, even though economic progress as the fuel of the process is without doubt of the great importance, varieties of other progress make a positive influence on the development of modern society.

    On the one hand, many governments pay more attention to economic development than other aspects of life as they believe that economic growth plays an important role in the development of a nation. When a country's economy develops, it ensures business ventures and job opportunities, and the government can collect more funds through taxes. This fund could be used for the improvement of other sectors such as education, public infrastructures, and military services.  

    On the other hand, despite the fact that economic growth plays an essential part, governments should never overlook the positive performance of other aspects. The gross domestic product or other equivalent figures which reflect the financial performance of a country will not see a rise without the support of a secure social condition, stable political condition, and advanced educational system. For instance, merchants will not place their investments in countries that have insecure political conditions such as Afghanistan or Iraq. Moreover, without the existence of educated and skilled workers, it will be difficult for a country to improve its industrial and trade activities. Therefore, the growth of the economic sectors should be aligned with other important sectors.

    In conclusion, it is undeniable that economic growth plays an important role in the development of a nation. However, I personally believe that besides economic progress, better education, social welfare, security, and political stability are equally important for the sustainable development of a nation.

    Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes (for example working for a charity, improving the neighbourhood or teaching sports to younger children).

    To what extent do you agree or disagree?

    Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

答案

    There are always debates on whether non-salary community service in form of working for a charity or improving the neighborhood should be compulsory for high school students. In my opinion, although engaging in community service can benefit high school students, making it a compulsory part of high school programs is unacceptable and even lets the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.

    The main reason why I argue against the idea of compulsory community service is that the school curriculum is already full of academic subjects. Therefore, students are occupied with their studies and barely have time for it because of the heavy study pressure. In addition, making it a compulsory part of high school programs can make students even more pressured and upset. For instance, the activities may take up the leisure time of students who wants to get a break and relax after some important exams. Moreover, I believe teenage students would be reluctant to take part in any program of obligatory work, and this can lead to poor motivation and even bad behaviors.

    Conversely, the opportunity to do voluntary community service can be extremely positive for high school students. To begin with, by making these programs optional, schools can make sure that only motivated students take part. These participants can gain valuable experience in an adult working environment, which can enhance their skills and build their self-confidence. Moreover, with the working experience, students can richen their resume and therefore, get better career prospects. For instance, a period of voluntary work experience may impress a university admission committee or a future employer.

    In conclusion, instead of making community service compulsory, I believe a voluntary one is a better choice.
