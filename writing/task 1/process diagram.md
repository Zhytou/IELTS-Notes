The diagram outlines the process of electricity production in a hydroelectric power station. The process begins when the water flows from the river into a high-level reservoir and ends with the transmission of electricity to the national grid.

In general, the process is broadly distributed into day and night stages with the daylight stages involving electricity production from a river and storage of water in a reservoir. At night, the water flows back in the opposite direction towards an initial reservoir and the river.

The day stage of the process involves channelling the river water into a high-level reservoir backed up by a dam. There is an intake area leading to the power station that opens during the day and closes at night. Water flows during the day to generate electricity through the power station turbines. The generated electricity is then sent to a national grid through power lines while the excess water runs to a low-level reservoir.

During the night stage, the water stored in the low-level reservoir is reverted to the power station and the turbines of the generator pump it back into the high-level reservoir which is closed during the night. The river water is stored at the upper level and later it flows down, starting the cycle again.

The diagrams below show the stages and equipment used in the cement-making process, and how cement is used to produce concrete for building purposes.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

The process given by the flow charts is about the detailed steps and facilities which are utilized in the production of cement and concrete.

As for the first chart, cement production involves the following certain steps. At first, limestone and clay are set into a crusher, by which they become powder. After being mixed, the powder is transmitted into the next rotating process and it will be heated. Next, the mixture goes into a grinder where the cement comes out. Finally, the cement can be packed in bags. In terms of concrete production, in the first step, 25% sand and 50% small stones are put together, with a combination of 15% cement and 10% water. In the next stage, the mixture can be poured into a concrete mixer. Finally, the production of concrete is successfully completed.

All in all, it is clear to see that compared with the production of cement, that of concrete is rather simple.

The diagrams below show the life cycle of the silkworm and the stages in the production of silk cloth.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

The first diagram shows that there are four main stages in the life of the silkworm. First of all, eggs are produced by the moth and it takes ten days for each egg to become a silkworm larva that feeds on mulberry leaves. This stage lasts for up to six weeks until the larva produces a cocoon of silk thread around itself. After a period of about three weeks, the adult moths eventually emerge from these cocoons and the life cycle begins again.

The cocoons are the raw material used for the production of silk cloth. Once selected, they are boiled in water and the threads can be separated in the unwinding stage. Each thread is between 300 and 900 metres long, which means they can be twisted together, dyed and then used to produce cloth in the weaving stage.

Overall, the diagrams show that the cocoon stage of the silkworm can be used to produce silk cloth through a very simple process.

The diagram below shows how instant noodles are manufactured.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

The given picture illustrates the process by which instant noodles are produced.

Overall, it is clear that there are 8 stages in this linear process, commencing with storing flour in silos and ending with labeling and sealing cups.

At the first stage of this process, flour is pumped from a truck into tower silos for storage before being put into a mixing machine, where it is mixed with a combination of water and oil. After this stage has been completed, the resulting mixture is rolled over to create dough sheets, and then going through a machine to be separated into strips.

During the next stage, these dough strips are molded into noodles discs, after which they are cooked with oil and left to dry. Following this, these dried noodles discs, together with vegetables and spices, are put into cups, and the process finally ends with these cups being labeled and sealed.
