Generally speaking, many new facilities have been constructed for tourists, including accommodations, restaurant, swimming facilities etc. and those have been built without affecting the natural resources that much.

Before the facilities were constructed, there was only trees and beach on the island and most of the places were empty. In this island, many new tourists’ facilities have been made including accommodation facilities, restaurant, reception centre, pier for boating, swimming facility on the beach and so on. Interestingly plants and trees were not cut down to build these constructions and most of the constructions were made near the beach.

Besides, footpaths and roads for commuting have been built to facilitate the tourists. The footpaths were made to walk between the residing places and the beach while the motor tracks were created to visit the restaurant, reception area, and pier for boating.

In summary, the construction was mainly made to facilitate the tourists' stay, visit and amusement and for that, no plants or trees were cut.

The maps outline the changes that took place in a public park called Grange Park from 1920 to today.

Overall, the park was changed and renovated to offer people more possibilities than they used to have decades ago such as a cafe, theatre, playground and parking.

In detail, the park was opened in 1920 and entertainment facilities including a larger stage and various areas for recreation have since been added to it. There was also notable relocation in terms of seats and the only areas that remained unchanged were the entrances and one minor garden. Besides, the fountain has been removed in favour of a rose garden with full seating arrangements around it. To the left of the new garden, the previous stage for musicians has been turned into a much larger amphitheatre facing the opposite direction that will allow for concerts in the park. This change has necessitated the removal of both seatings on the far left side as well as the rose garden in the bottom left corner of the map.

Moreover, the pond for water plants was removed from the right-top part of the garden and a children's play area was introduced in the right-top of the park, and near this area, a cafe was built. Instead of the pond, a water feature has been built occupying the bottom right corner. Interestingly, the number of rose gardens was reduced to two. Besides, an underground car park was built in the lower right corner of the park.
