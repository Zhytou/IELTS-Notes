The bar charts compare four destinations excluding full-time work of  British graduates and postgraduates after leaving college in 2008. It is clear that further study was by far the most popular choice among both graduates and postgraduates, while the fewest students devoted themselves to voluntary work. However, the proportion of graduates who engaged in a part-time job was lower than the equivalent figure of postgraduates.

In 2008, 29665 graduates chose to study for higher education, while the equivalent figure for postgraduates was 2725. Part-time work accounted for the second highest proportion of placements of graduates and postgraduates Graduates who worked part-time and those who were unemployed were very similar in number, at 17735 and 16235 respectively. However, the same was not true for postgraduate students. Far more postgraduates did part-time work, at 2535, than went into unemployment at 1625. As for voluntary work, 3500 graduates and 345 postgraduates chose to do it.

The bar chart compares the overall amount of time spent on three different types of telephone calls in the UK over a period of 7 years.

In general, both the minutes for national and international fixed-line calls and mobile phone calls witnessed a gradual growth, whereas the counterpart for local fixed-line calls reached a peak and fell back at the end of the period. Despite the fact that British people spent less time than before on local-fixed line calls in the last three years, the minutes for local fixed-line calls still ranked the highest among the three selected categories.

In 1995, people in the UK spent 70 billion minutes on local fixed-line calls, and the equivalent figure for national and international fixed-line calls was 40 billion minutes, while only a negligible amount of time, less than 10 billion minutes, was spent on mobile phone calls. The time which the British spent on fixed-line calls reached a peak of 90 billion minutes in 1999. Conversely, the minutes of the other two types of calls saw an increase of less than 10 billion.

Although local fixed-line calls had fallen back to the 1995 figure, approximately 70 billion, by 2002,  it still was the most popular among the three types of call. The counterpart for national and international fixed-line calls and mobile phone calls was 60 and  40 billion respectively.
