        分数的说法是分子在前、分母在后。分子以基数（one， two， three）表示，分母以序数（first， second， third）等表示，分子超过1时，分母要加-s
    
        1/7 = one-seventh， a seventh
        1/3 = one-third， a third
        3/5 = three-fifths
        2/6 = two-sixths

    特殊表达：
        分数中的分母为2时，要用half表示，但不可以用second
　　    分母为4时，除了用fourth外也可以用quarter

        1/2 = one-half， a half
        1/4 = one-fourth， one-quarter
        3/4 = three-fourths， three-quarters

    复杂表达：
        如果碰到复杂的分数时，只要在分母和分子的中间加上over就可以了

        327/465 = three hundred and twenty-seven over four hundred and sixty-five

The chart presents the average CO2 emissions per person in four European nations from 1967 to 2007.

Overall, average CO2 emissions of individuals in the UK and Sweden generally dropped, whereas emissions per person in Italy and Portugal rose significantly. Despite the steady reduction, average emissions in the UK were the highest in the given period.

Among the selected countries, the CO2 emissions per person in the UK were the highest throughout the four decades, yet said emissions were on the decline. In 1967, the average emissions per person were nearly 11 metric tonnes. But by 2007, that had fallen to roughly 9 metric tonnes. Somewhat similarly, the average CO2 emissions in Sweden were almost 9 metric tonnes per person in 1967. The emissions spiked, however, to nearly 11 metric tonnes in 1977 though from there, emissions continuously fell, dropping to just 5.5 metric tonnes in 2007.

Conversely, both Italy’s and Portugal’s carbon dioxide emissions per person increased between 1967 and 2007. Italy’s CO2 emissions nearly doubled, starting at just above 4 metric tonnes in 1967 and ending at almost 8 metric tonnes four decades later. Portugal’s CO2 emissions, however, nearly quadrupled. The per capita average in 1967 was just 1.5 metric tonnes. But in 2007, the emissions had reached 5.5 metric tonnes, matching Sweden's average.

The two line charts illustrate the ratio of households with electrical appliances and the number of hours spent on housework including washing clothes, preparing meals, and cleaning over a period of 90 years respectively.

In general, the proportion of ownership of three electrical appliances witnessed a large growth, whereas the amount of time spent on housework declined dramatically. Both the refrigerator and vacuum cleaner accounted for the highest ratio among the three different types of appliances.

In 1920, 40 percent of households owned a washing machine, ranking the highest among the three appliances, while the counterpart for vacuum cleaners was 30 percent, and only a negligible amount of families had a refrigerator. However, in 1960, the ownership of refrigerators increased dramatically and accounted for 90 percent, surpassing the other two appliances which were both owned by 70 percent of families. At the end of nine decades, almost every household owned a vacuum cleaner and a refrigerator, while the equivalent figure for washing machines was just above 70 percent.

Conversely, the number of hours spent on housework saw a huge decrease, starting at 50 hours per week in 1920 and ending at 10 hours after nine decades.
